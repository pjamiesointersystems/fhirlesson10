""" FHIR Bundles Require resource to Be a FHIR Resource
In a transaction or batch Bundle:

The entry.resource field must contain a valid FHIR resource (e.g., Patient, Observation, Binary, etc.).
JSON Patch documents (arrays of operations) are not valid FHIR resources ‚Äî they are just raw JSON.
üí° So you can't directly insert a JSON Patch array into entry.resource. That would violate the FHIR schema, and servers would reject it.
2. The Binary Resource is Designed for Raw Data
FHIR defines Binary as a wrapper for arbitrary binary content (like PDFs, images, or JSON blobs).

It includes:
contentType ‚Äì specifying the MIME type (e.g., application/json-patch+json)
data ‚Äì Base64-encoded content
üîê This allows you to embed any arbitrary payload (including JSON Patch) inside a valid FHIR resource, which makes it acceptable inside a bundle.

‚úÖ 3. PATCH + Binary Enables Transactional Updates
The trick is this:

You create a Binary resource that contains a base64-encoded JSON Patch document.
You then PATCH a target resource (e.g., Patient/1), using that Binary as the body. """
